Pool Table Project Notes

Steps:
- make a pool table class - needs to store if occupied/not, timer, cost

To do:
- List all the tables and their statuses
- when occupied, move into a different array
- store information about each table session: table #, start time, end time, total time, cost
- print available tables
- if someone chooses an unavailable table, print"Currently occupied"
- 30 dollars per hour is .50 per minute
- if time>60


To learn:
- figure out time
- how to email (imapclient)


List of possible functions needed:
check_status - check to see if the table is occupied or not
show_tables - show all tables and their respective statuses
if_occupied - if the table is occupied, show the timer and start time


assign_table - assign table to a user and then begin timer and change table's status to occupied
log_on_close - sends info to file when status moves back to unoccupied (or maybe as the else of an if?)
